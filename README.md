# StickerApp

This App was developed as part of a university thesis. It was used in a study in which participants produced a drawing of how they imagine the city around where they live.

The App provides a white canvas that can be moved around and offers a selection of stickers that can be placed on the canvas, moved around and deleted again. If a study is started via the top-most menu bar, a csv-file will be created at the end of the drawing which includes the entered
home adress of the participant, as well as their ID-number and the time it took them to finish the drawing. The file also includes a list of all Stickers on the Canvas. The drawing will be downloaded as a jpeg-file.
