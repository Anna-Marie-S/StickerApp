# StickerApp

This App was developed as part of a university thesis. It was used in a study in which participants produced a drawing of how they imagine the city around where they live.  
The App provides a white canvas that can be moved and offers a selection of stickers that can be placed on the canvas, moved around and deleted again. If a study is started via the top-most menu bar, at the end of the drawing, you can download a csv-file which includes the entered
home adress of the participant, as well as their ID-number and the time it took them to finish the drawing. The file also includes a list of all Stickers on the Canvas. The Drawing will be downloaded as a jpeg-file.
